An ecommerce	platform	where	any	student can	sell	their	clothes,	textbooks,furniture etc.	to	other	students	on	campus.	 This	already	happens	on	a	Facebook	group	called	Free	&	For	sale at McGill.	The	platform	should	allow	the	seller	to	set	their	minimum	price	and	the	potential	buyers	to	bid	on the	items.	A	seller	will	be	allowed	to	see	each	bid,	seen	from	an	anonymous	buyer	but	the	rating	of	the	buyer	will	be	visible, and	approve	to	complete	the	transaction	of	one	bid	only.	Once	a	transaction	takes	
place,	 the	 item	 will	 be	 removed	 from	 the	 items	 on	 sale,	 and	 the	 buyer	 and	 the	 seller	 will	 have	 to	
communicate	 through	 email	 to	 set	 up	 a	 time	 for	 delivery	 or	 pickup.	 The	 platform's	 main	 goal	 is	 to	
facilitate	the	trading	of	second	hand	items	that	the	student	doesnâ€™t	use	anymore.	It	is	easy for	students	
to	meet	each	other	since	usually	most	students	live	around	the	campus.
